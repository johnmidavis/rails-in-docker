# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.
(okay, let's do that) 

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version (2.5.1)

* System dependencies
(well, I am assuming that you have Docker engine installed - I am using 18.05.0)

* Configuration
( I should create a docker-compose.yml)

* Database creation
( I'll use a Postres container - needs done)

* Database initialization
( same - needs done)

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
